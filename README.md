# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

I have built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- much like a dating app. This site will take in results from our users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I used Express package to handle routing. The final app is deployed to Heroku so other users can fill it out in real time.


### Folder Structure

* For this app, I have followed an specified folder structre and Created the main called `FriendFinder`. Inside the folder, I have organized the directories and files for easy access and understaning!


### How the app works!

* The app starts with the survey should that has 10 questions of for the user to answer. Each answer is     scaled 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.
* Based on user's answers, the app determines the user's most compatible friend. 
* The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.
* After the current user's most compatible friend is found, the app will display the result as a modal      pop-up, with the match name and picture.
* The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.


### Deployment and hosting on Heroku

The app is deployed on Heroku hosting server so other users should be able to enter their data and find their closet match through this app.
